# spirit guardian
afk game about idk taking care of a spirit or something

this is unfinished and will be continued this week

## what the hack am i lookin at
so you have to protect this very not suspicious looking sentient pile of leaves. 

It has three bars: first bar is collected leaves, second is happiness, third is rest.

leaves accumulate over time when the spirit is outside, and they are the main currency in the game.

happiness impacts leaf accumulation speed, can be increased in shed slightly or by feeding

rest goes down when collecting leaves, and up in the shed.

you can buy stuff from the shop and apply their effects in the shed

## controls
use the mouse bud

## idk what an afk game is lol
ok so basically the resources accumulate while you are away, so feel free to touch grass and when you return ur lil guy still keeps going

however because this is a game that has to be addicting, if you leave for too long the guy gets sad and his happiness goes down.
when not happy anymore he becomes restless and... loses rest. wow
