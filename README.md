# spirit guardian
afk game about idk taking care of a spirit or something

> w1 comment: this is unfinished and will be continued this week

> w2 comment: a lot more finished now, might consider continuing it but its genuinely such a boring game

## week 2 updates
added beds, clocks, mirrors, drawings. I am not lying when I say this has to be top 5 most boring coding things I've had to go through.

added themes (spooky theme because duh, and along with the theme you get a free jumpscare)

added the farm and feeding the stuff

also we got settings (SPEED UP TIME! YOU lovely reviewers HAVE NO ATTENTION SPAN! (i dont either))

and cool anim effects idk what more to say

## what the hack am i lookin at
so you have to protect this very not suspicious looking sentient pile of leaves (or ghost if you like that one more). 

It has three bars: first bar is collected leaves/souls, second is happiness, third is rest.

leaves accumulate over time when the spirit is outside, and they are the main currency in the game.

happiness impacts leaf accumulation speed, can be increased in shed slightly or by feeding items

rest goes down when collecting leaves, and up in the shed.

you can buy stuff from the shop and apply their effects in the shed.

how to get stuff to feed the guy you ask???? well that's what the farm is for! get yo stuff here and feed it to increase happiness

## controls
use the mouse bud

## idk what an afk game is lol
ok so basically the resources accumulate while you are away, so feel free to touch grass and when you return ur lil guy still keeps going

however because this is a game that has to be addicting, if you leave for too long the guy gets sad and his happiness goes down.
when not happy anymore he becomes restless and... loses rest. wow

NEW Adddition you can speed up the time in the settings bar. Game changing stuff.
